**Learning:** Icon-only buttons with notification badges are a common accessibility trap. Users with screen readers often miss the notification count if it's not explicitly part of the accessible name or description.
**Action:** When adding badges to buttons, always ensure the count is included in the `aria-label` or provided via a screen-reader-only span that describes the count (e.g., "5 pending items"). Also, use Tooltips for mouse users instead of `title` attributes for better consistency and accessibility.
